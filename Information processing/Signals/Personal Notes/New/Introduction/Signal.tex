\section{What is a signal}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{itemize}
  \item A function of one or more variables representing data
  \item Represented by a physical aspects e.g. voltage
  \item Measured by observing physical aspects
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Continuous-time and discrete-time}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Continuous: 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Signal defined for all time $t$
    \item E.g. sound
  \end{itemize}
  \item Discrete: 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Signal defined only at discrete instants of time $nT_s$
    \item E.g. Digital music
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Even and odd}

\begin{itemize}
  \item All signals composed of even and odd components
  $$
    x(t) = x_e(t) + x_o(t)
  $$

  \item Even:
  $$
    x_e(t) = \frac{1}{2}[x(t) + x(-t)]
  $$
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Positive and negative are the same
    $$
      x_e(t) = x_e(-t)
    $$
  \end{itemize}

  \item Odd:
  $$
    x_o(t) = \frac{1}{2}[x(t) - x(-t)]
  $$
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Positive and negative are different
    $$
      x_o(t) = -x_o(-t)
    $$
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Periodic and non-periodic}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Continuous-time periodic $T_0$ signal:
  $$
    x(t) = x(t + T_0) \; \forall t
  $$

  \item Discrete-time periodic $N_0$ signal:
  $$
    x[n] = x[n + N_0]
  $$
  
\end{itemize}
