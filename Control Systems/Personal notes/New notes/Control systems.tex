Notation:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $S_{\Theta}$: System to be controlled
    \item $C$: Controller
    \item $\Theta$: System parameters
    \item $y$: Controlled variable i.e. output
    \item $u$: Control variable (accessible)
    \item $d$: Disturbance factors
    \item $w$: Reference variable i.e. point 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Control system objective}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{itemize}
    \item Act on $u$ to maintain $y \approx w$ in the presence of uncertainty
    \begin{align*}
        d  &= \bar{d} + \Delta d \\
        \Theta &= \bar{\Theta} + \Delta \Theta
    \end{align*}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\bar{d}$ and $\bar{\Theta}$ are known nominal values i.e. expected
        \item $\Delta d$ and $\Delta \Theta$ are uncertainties 
    \end{itemize}

    \item Uncertainty $\Delta d$ may have a known upper bound
    $$
        |\Delta d| < \bar{D}
    $$

\end{itemize}

\section{Controller}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Two kinds of controllers:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Analog: Receives analog inputs and outputs analog 
        \item Digital: Processes digital sampled variables in computing devices
    \end{itemize}

    \item Conversion between two types requires: \textbf{ADC} and \textbf{DAC}
    \item Converters are synchronised via clock signal - period $T_s$
    \item Discrete-time variables can be expressed with time index
    $$
        t_k = kT_s \Rightarrow k
    $$
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Digital control systems}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Hybrid systems} with analog and digital variables 
\end{itemize}
