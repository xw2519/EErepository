\section{Impulse response $H$ of an LTI system}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{itemize}
  \item Impulse response represents the LTI system behaviour
  \item Unknown systems determined with impulse input:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Discrete: Unit impulse function 
    \item Continuous: Approximated Dirac delta function
  \end{itemize}
  \item Response used to determine the output to any input
  \item Linked to system inputs:
\end{itemize}

\section{Convolution $*$}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{itemize}
  \item LTI output is convolution of input with impulse response
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Continuous (Convolution integral):
    $$
      y(t) = x(t) * h(t) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty x(\tau)h(t-\tau) d\tau
    $$
    \item Discrete (Convolution sum):
    $$
      y[n] = x[n] * h[n] = \sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty x[k]h[n-k]
    $$
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
