\subsection{Analysing software systems}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Aspects to consider:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item System high-level functions
        \item System nodes
        \item Types of data managed and processed
        \item Data movement within the system
    \end{itemize}

    \item Usually expressed with pictures
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Modelling data (Database)}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Data is always stored, transformed and analysed
    \item \textbf{Abstract Data Model} used to understand process
    \item \textbf{Database theory} creates the Abstract Data Model
    \item Database theory considers:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Important entities in Database
        \item \textbf{Attributes} of these entities
        \item \textbf{Relationships} between these entities
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Entity modelling} formally expresses database theory
    \item \textbf{Database systems} implements the Abstract Data Model
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Moving data (Network)}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Process of data moving between nodes
    \item \textbf{Network models} defines the type of network structure
    \item \textbf{Network protocol} and \textbf{API} implements the model
\end{itemize}
